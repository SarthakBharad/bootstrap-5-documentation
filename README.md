Bootstrap 5 is a newer version of Bootstrap, which is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites.

This tutorial follows Bootstrap 5 (released 2021), which is the newest version of Bootstrap; with new components, faster stylesheet and more responsiveness. It supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. However, Internet Explorer 11 and down is not supported. The main differences between Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap 3 & 4, is that Bootstrap 5 has switched to JavaScript instead of jQuery.

What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development.
Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins.
Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs.

Why Use Bootstrap?
- Easy to use: Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using Bootstrap
- Responsive features: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops
- Mobile-first approach: In Bootstrap, mobile-first styles are part of the core framework
- Browser compatibility: Bootstrap 5 is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera). Note that if you need support for IE11 and down, you must use either BS4 or BS3.

There are two ways to start using Bootstrap 5 on your own web site. You can:
- Include Bootstrap 5 from a CDN
- Download Bootstrap 5 from getbootstrap.com

Bootstrap 5 CDN
If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap 5 yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). jsDelivr provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript:

- MaxCDN:
  <!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

  <!-- Latest compiled JavaScript -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>

If you want to download and host Bootstrap 5 yourself, go to https://getbootstrap.com/, and follow the instructions there.

HOW TO USE THE DOCUMENTATION:

The PDF labelled "Bootstrap 5 Documentation.pdf" contains complete documenataion for the Bootstrap 4 framework along with detiled descriptions for various functionalities and features it provides in building a website alogn with screenshots for the results.

The code for the screenshots have been uploaded as HTML files in various folders and some as seperate individual files which you can go through to get a sense of basics. To understand which file gives a specific output, I have labelled the files based upon their functioning in the documentation and the folders are labelled according to the headings present in the documentation.
